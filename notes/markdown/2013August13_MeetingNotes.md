# Methodology / Rationale

## Why:
Identified current and future need presented by BVTF as well as inquiries 
from various church members regarding future facility needs.  

## What:  
Consistory has asked a team to review the report presented by the BVTF and 
put a recommendation together that would address those needs as well as consider 
future growth needs of NHRC.  The report will address the needs identified in 
the BVTF report.  The report will also include additions to the building and 
layout of the new facility on the existing property.

*	Consider current building updates, roof, boilers and etc.
	*	Replace current boilers within next 3 months (already in progress?)
		*	BOILER REPLACEMENT CAN START NOW***
	*	Location of electrical boxes and utilities
	*	Lighting in sanctuary is poor. Could be addressed in next year.
		*	Would interior updates be part of updating building?
*	Fellowship Hall ([p16][2012_Report])
	*	Gymnasium / Multipurpose Room
*	Kitchen ([p16][2012_Report])
	* New appliances (especially stove, more freezers)
	*	Is it a long term use? Or just 5 yrs or 10 yrs? Depends on next generation.
	*	**“Don’t build it and expect them to come. Build it with a PLAN.”**
*	Exterior ([p17][2012_Report])
	*	Entry for car port at Sanctuary level
	*	Grade for accessibility for downstairs and upstairs
	*	Fast and big elevators
	*	Handicap Parking (number and location)
	*	Wheelchair accessibility from parking lot and within church
	*	Entry door confusion
	*	Confusion on flow once in the church (where’s the nursery?)
	*	Indoor Storage - Custodial
	*	Outdoor Storage - building and grounds
	*	Memorial Garden – options? Cremation memorial wall or in ground?
	*	Parking Lot (near end of list, but still need to maintain it)
*	Centralized offices - Staff
*	Classrooms - Storage ([p18][2012_Report])
	*	Classroom size
	*	Technology in the classrooms (only 2 TVs on carts)
	*	Education storage
*	Sanctuary
	*	Size (can seat about 400 people, average number was 236, high at 277)
	*	What fullness level makes it uncomfortable for visitors? 80%?
	*	Maybe new sanctuary added on at ground level?
	*	Repurpose current sanctuary space?
*	Roofline
	*	Would that need to be adjusted? Leave it for an architect.
	*	NO FLAT ROOFS.
*	Technology
	*	Classrooms need server? No.
	*	Church management system is on the cloud.
	*	Video feed of service for nursery or cry room. 
	*	Video would need lighting and wiring, but that’s all.
	*	Sound system can move to any part of building very easily.
	*	Only sound issue would come up if we changed design of sanctuary.

## Who:
8-10 individuals with knowledge of the church facility to assist with current 
needs of the church as well as those that can think forward about the future 
needs of the church and community.

## How:
The team will work together on a macro level to accomplish this goal as well as 
use sub-committees that can focus on specific tasks. 

## When:
Not defined.
