    <h2>Attendance / Sanctuary Seating Capacity</h2>

    <p>The approximate combined seating capacity (upstairs and downstairs) of the sanctuary is 400 people. Sunday morning attendance from April 30 â€“ June 2 averaged 236, with the high of 277 and a low of 155. During this time period, the lowest attendance took place on Memorial weekend.</p>
    <p>The BVTF suggests  that church attendance is counted during the fall and winter months to determine when/if sanctuary changes are necessary to accommodate the growing number of people.</p>
