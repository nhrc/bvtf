    <h1>RECOMMENDATIONS</h1>

    <h2>CLASSROOMS / MEETING ROOMS</h2>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ministry teams identified classrooms as a priority. The BVTF recommends the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger classrooms for future growth.</li>
<li>Add meeting rooms for adults.</li>
<li>Signage throughout the building making classrooms and meeting rooms easier to find.</li>
<li>Additional storage in classrooms.</li>
<li>Add audio/visual equipment (most rooms lack these capabilities).</li>
<li>Update the consistory room.</li>
<li>Increase natural lighting in classrooms (current windows block sunlight).</li>
<li>Explore the possibility of having “themes” to each or several of the classrooms.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>OFFICES</h2>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>Based primarily upon the staff questionnaire responses, the BVTF recommends that any future addition or change to the building incorporate more centralized offices for staff and supplies to facilitate sharing of information and equipment. Also, offices should be arranged near a main entrance so that staff can easily greet and welcome church members and visitors.</p>

    <h2>STORAGE</h2>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>The BVTF recommends that more storage areas be made available in classrooms for teachers, indoor storage for custodial staff and ministry teams, and outdoor storage for building and grounds.</p>
