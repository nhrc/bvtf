    <p>(downstairs)</p>

    <h3>Discoveries from Questionnaires</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fellowship area is too small for all-church events (Harvest Feast, Auction, etc).</li>
      <li>Fellowship area is not centrally located and lacks clearly identifiable entrances to welcome visitors and members.</li>
      <li>Fellowship area is not well-suited for wheelchair accessibility.</li>
      <li>Kitchen needs updating:

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Kitchen is not centrally located â€“ inconvenient for activities located upstairs.</li>
      <li>The fellowship area should be on the same floor as sanctuary (or has a ramp and updated elevator).</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This would provide better accessibility for visitors, wheelchairs, seniors, etc.</li>
          <li>This would prevent some safety concerns for small children, seniors, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>New fellowship area needs wheelchair accessible bathrooms.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>The Fellowship Hall and Kitchen have been identified as areas of concern because of their lack of functionality.  The BVTF team believes this area does not meet the current needs of the church and as a result is under utilized.   The Fellowship Hall should be one of the focal areas of the church.  By its namesake, this area needs to be  accessible, easy to locate in the building and regularly used instead of tucked away in the basement.</p>
    <p>The Fellowship Hall and the Kitchen area complement one another and are often used for the same functions.  They need to be next to one another, so that service from the kitchen can happen efficiently.</p>
    <p>A large multi-purpose room with an attached kitchen would be ideal for all-church
functions, Sunday school and youth group activities, receptions, community
activities, etc.</p>
    <p>If a new fellowship area and kitchen are included in an addition, the current
fellowship area/kitchen could be revamped for more classrooms, storage, etc.</p>
