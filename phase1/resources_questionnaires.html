    <p>Considering the facility "as is", what enhances the effectiveness of the RIOT ministry?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Youth room is right by an entryway, easy for us to greet kids and parents and help other parents find their way to Kid Connection if necessary</li>
      <li>Office is close in case we need to make copies</li>
      <li>There are some bathroom options close (but boys is downstairs and girls have to use the single room with the heavy door unless they go downstairs and around the corner)</li>
      <li>Building is great for playing Sardines</li>
      <li>Coffee area is great for our size group once in awhile</li>
      <li>Narthex has great small group spot for when we want to break apart for discussions§ Plenty of seating for our current group size (approx. 16 kids and 4 leaders)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Considering the facility "as is", what impedes the effectiveness of the RIOT ministry?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bathrooms on different levels and with heavy door can be difficult for some of the kids</li>
      <li>Chapel Room is inadequate
        <ul>
          <li>Space constraints for games (have to go outside or hope Fellowship Room isn’t in use)</li>
          <li>Gets hot in there sometimes (can’t open windows)</li>
          <li>Love that stained glass is preserved, but not the best in a youth room where kids can get rowdy sometimes</li>
          <li>Hanging lights are sometimes a hazard… Rather, they have close calls with being damaged</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>List and rank recommendations</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Indoor space for run-around games</li>
      <li>WiFi that is reliable and accessible anywhere in the Chapel Room and more places in the church</li>
      <li>Sound System in youth room (for listening to music or integrating with laptop/projector for YouTube videos</li>
      <li>New TV that's easy to hook up laptop, iPad or DVD player</li>
      <li>Move basketball hoops towards playground (away from mid-parking lot where ball rolls towards road</li>
      <li>Better kitchenette for snacks
        <ul>
          <li>Fridge for storing pop (current is too small for 2-liters</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Basketball hoop away from road</li>
      <li>Bathrooms and kitchen-type facilities closer or on same level<li>
      <li>Like youth room near entry/exit (always able to greet parents/kids and keep in touch with parents better), if it were closer to playground area, would give kids safer spot to hang out while waiting for rides rather than near front sign and road.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently how many kids are in the RIOT program?</p>
    <ul><li>16</li></ul>
    <p>Do you expect to see growth in the RIOT program in the next year(s)?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a ton based on the now - kids sometimes bring friends, but not regularly</li>
      <li>Probably will stay under 20 kids for next couple of years</li>
      <li>Biggest concerns are the space and future growth of the RIOT group. Eventually we will outgrow the chapel</li>
