          <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

          <p>In this report the building team is presenting 2 drawings representing ideas on what the new addition may look like.  It should be noted that even with the work done to develop these drawings there are factors and design options that could not all be captured in the scope of this project.  NHRC’s long term goals, facility use and financial position will need to be part of the final design of the building.</p>

          <p>Accompanying the drawings in this report you will find commentary which will include points that the team felt to be important to document related to the building construction but also thoughts around the use of the building.  The team did conduct a meeting with a cross section of NHRC members where the organization called “Building Gods Way” and their concepts were presented in video form.  We want to make sure that it is understood that the reason for the meeting was to present concepts and thoughts related to the church building and not a solicitation to promote their services.  This topic will be presented later in this report.</p>

          <p>It is requested that in order to understand the total scope of the information presented in this document that NHRC consistory review closely the comments presented, the drawings, but also watch the video’s played on the “Building God’s Way” concept and prayerfully consider more than just the brick and mortar buildin involved with construction but also the uses and management of the facility.</p>
