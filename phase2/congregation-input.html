          <h1>Congregation Meeting and Questionnaire</h1>

          <p>The building team felt it appropriate to make every effort to continue to involve the congregation as much as possible as we continue this process.  The intent of this smaller segment of the congregation meeting was:<p>

          <ol>
            <li>To present the concept’s used in “Building Gods Way” ministries.</li>
            <li>To get feedback on the concepts presented in the video – played during the meeting.</li>
            <li>To get input on what the congregation felt to be important to have in an addition.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The questions asked and the responses can be found in Appendix A along with a link to the video.</p>

          <p>Congregation members invited to this meeting represented a sample of different age groups and family make up.  33 members from the congregation were invited to the meeting; winter weather conditions unfortunately had a negative impact on the number of people that were able to attend impacting attendance to approximately 15, but still a good cross section of ages.</p>

          <p>The team does suggest that this video be viewed by consistory for content and the sake of concepts.  There are for sure some topics presented that should be considered.</p>
