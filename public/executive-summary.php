    <h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>

    <p>Recommendations from the BVTF suggest that actions be taken in a number of areas of our church facilities.<br/>The narthex, fellowship hall, kitchen, exterior, classrooms, meeting rooms, offices and storage have been identified as areas that require attention.</p>
    <p>It is our recommendation that changes be made to the narthex in order to improve the overall pedestrian flow in and out of the sanctuary as well as reduce congestion during social functions. The BVTF team believes the Fellowship Hall and Kitchen does not meet the current needs of the church and as a result is under utilized. Concern involving the Exterior of the church pertained mostly to areas that complement the church. Concerns about the parking lot were expressed. (The need for parking lot improvements had been identified prior to this report.) Handicap parking, wheelchair accessibility and confusion about which doors to enter the church were other identified concerns. The current “main” entrance is hidden in back, which may not be noticed by visitors. After entering the building, people often have a difficult time locating the sanctuary, classrooms, nursery, bathrooms, etc. Based primarily upon the staff questionnaire responses, the BVTF recommends that any future addition or change to the building incorporate more centralized offices. The BVTF recommends that more storage areas be made available in classrooms for teachers, indoor storage for custodial staff and ministry teams, as well as outdoor storage for building and grounds. Most ministry teams identified classrooms as a priority.</p>
    <p>The BVTF believes it will be necessary to carefully consider each recommendation and how addressing one area may impact another in order to maximize both meeting the church’s needs and being faithful stewards of the funds available to the church. It should be noted that making recommendations on an order in which each task should be handled is difficult as in certain situations a remedy in one area may lead to an improvement in another. Because of this it is our suggestion that an architect or consultant be brought in to assist with the final layout of the facility. Staying consistent with what the BVTF was tasked to do this report is not intended to explain how to do the work to make improvements or to proceed but to identify the opportunities that exist.<br/>We believe additional in depth work will be needed.</p>
